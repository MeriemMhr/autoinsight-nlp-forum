"dindak","October 2001"," Buy a 2001/ 2002 Oldsmobile Intrigue. It's one of the best sedans on the market with great handling and one of the best V6 engines around, a 3.5L DOHC producing 215HP. The deals should be great this year as it's the last on for Intrigue and the warrany on them has been extended to 5 years. The car is recommended by most magazines (including Consumer Reports), but is unfortunately over looked by most consumers. It is the sleeper of all sleepers on the market in my opinion. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Am looking at 1 of 4 choices to replace my 99GS400.

My 95Q was pig in snow, but I'm sure 2002Q is a world away from that. I've heard Audi has some QC problems, but I like their maintenance being included. I'm a happy Lexus driver. The Q appears to offer the most for the $$. Will lease and in this economy, I would think I could command an attractive package. Can I go wrong with any of the 4? Am I missing something? "
"mrdetailer","October 2001"," Generally a 3-4 year old car range is a good one because they are basically sound. If possible get one that is still under warrenty. But if not, make sure that a trusted Maxima mechanic goes over it thoroughly. Their V-6 is one of the best rated for over 10 years. Personally I am amazed at the great strides in American Quality recently, so the Olds may not be a bad idea other. "
"dindak","October 2001"," Maxima and Intrigue are both excellent choices for midsize sedans. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," If I had that kind of budget, I would go for the A6 4.2 - - best combination of sport and luxury amongst the 4 choices. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Actually, I was about to agree with the A6, but I just looked at the specs here on Edmunds. Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for. "
"black_tulip","October 2001"," I'd pass Intrigue only for one reason: crash test results are terrible... "
"paulo3","October 2001"," I would recommend the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry as my choices for a sedan. The new Nissan Altima looks impressive but I would wait until the reliability of the 2002 is proven.The new BMW 525 is another nice car and is rated highly by many auto publications. "
"kostamojen2","October 2001"," The only way to figure out what car you like is a test drive.

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "
"jdbtensai","October 2001"," i'm thinking of getting an audi s4 in the near future. anybody have one? what did you compare it with? anybody think of getting one and not get one? why? what did you get? "
"stgreen","October 2001"," I looked at S4 and 330xi. i liked s4 interior and exterior better, but ride was harsh as a daily commuter (17"" summer tires and wheels) and sport suspension as well. also, as a lease, i was going to have to purchase 4 snow tires (actually 5 - one for the trunk), because i live in new england...but, i really liked driving the s4. if it was for around town with little commute day in day out, i would have opted for s4..hope it helps.ps- i may ultimately get out of bmw lease early due to car having VERY little space and go for loaded passat GLX - what some call an audi A5... "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with. You can't fight your urges, I certainly know that.Personally, the sheer power and performance of the S6 would make me overlook the fact that its a wagon. My conscience would keep me awake at night if I chose a slower sedan just because its a sedan. But that's me. If it bothers you then stay clear. You have to be happy in your choice.good luck. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better.

Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "
"jdbtensai","October 2001"," i'm thinking of getting an audi s4 in the near future. anybody have one? what did you compare it with? anybody think of getting one and not get one? why? what did you get? "
"stgreen","October 2001"," I looked at S4 and 330xi. i liked s4 interior and exterior better, but ride was harsh as a daily commuter (17"" summer tires and wheels) and sport suspension as well. also, as a lease, i was going to have to purchase 4 snow tires (actually 5 - one for the trunk), because i live in new england...but, i really liked driving the s4. if it was for around town with little commute day in day out, i would have opted for s4..hope it helps.ps- i may ultimately get out of bmw lease early due to car having VERY little space and go for loaded passat GLX - what some call an audi A5... "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"mrdetailer","October 2001"," Generally a 3-4 year old car range is a good one because they are basically sound. If possible get one that is still under warrenty. But if not, make sure that a trusted Maxima mechanic goes over it thoroughly. Their V-6 is one of the best rated for over 10 years. Personally I am amazed at the great strides in American Quality recently, so the Olds may not be a bad idea other. "
"dindak","October 2001"," Maxima and Intrigue are both excellent choices for midsize sedans. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," If I had that kind of budget, I would go for the A6 4.2 - - best combination of sport and luxury amongst the 4 choices. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Actually, I was about to agree with the A6, but I just looked at the specs here on Edmunds. Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for. "

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000.

It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "

It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom.

My conscience would keep me awake at night if I chose a slower sedan just because its a sedan. But that's me. If it bothers you then stay clear. You have to be happy in your choice.good luck. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

I have looked at 96 Mazca Protoge (71K) 91 Toyota Corrolla (79k) 92 Toyota Corrolla (79K) and 92 Prizm (98K). The Camry is very clean and although older runs great and is a bit more substantial. The Mazda may be the best buy and in decent shape. All have automatic. Corola is clean as well but at same price Camry seems better buy. Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "
"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 in rebates from my GM card that's expiring.my 93 nissan sentra w/180k miles has started giving me grief within the past 3 months.

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "
"dindak","October 2001"," Maxima and Intrigue are both excellent choices for midsize sedans. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," If I had that kind of budget, I would go for the A6 4.2 - - best combination of sport and luxury amongst the 4 choices. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Actually, I was about to agree with the A6, but I just looked at the specs here on Edmunds. Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for. "
"black_tulip","October 2001"," I'd pass Intrigue only for one reason: crash test results are terrible... "
"paulo3","October 2001"," I would recommend the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry as my choices for a sedan. The new Nissan Altima looks impressive but I would wait until the reliability of the 2002 is proven.The new BMW 525 is another nice car and is rated highly by many auto publications. "
"kostamojen2","October 2001"," The only way to figure out what car you like is a test drive. And theres no reason to not test drive every car on the market But dont just test drive one car and say ""oh, i like it"" cause if you dont test drive the best cars and all the cars in your price range even (or out, helps as well), then you dont have any reference :P "
"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "
"jdbtensai","October 2001"," i'm thinking of getting an audi s4 in the near future. anybody have one? what did you compare it with? anybody think of getting one and not get one? why? what did you get? "
"stgreen","October 2001"," I looked at S4 and 330xi. i liked s4 interior and exterior better, but ride was harsh as a daily commuter (17"" summer tires and wheels) and sport suspension as well. also, as a lease, i was going to have to purchase 4 snow tires (actually 5 - one for the trunk), because i live in new england...but, i really liked driving the s4. if it was for around town with little commute day in day out, i would have opted for s4..hope it helps.ps- i may ultimately get out of bmw lease early due to car having VERY little space and go for loaded passat GLX - what some call an audi A5...

"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with. You can't fight your urges, I certainly know that.Personally, the sheer power and performance of the S6 would make me overlook the fact that its a wagon.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "

"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Actually, I was about to agree with the A6, but I just looked at the specs here on Edmunds. Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for. "

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with. You can't fight your urges, I certainly know that.Personally, the sheer power and performance of the S6 would make me overlook the fact that its a wagon.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think.

"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "

"
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist.

The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "

They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell"" - peteri.So what? This sounds like an ideal situation for you. A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

I have looked at 96 Mazca Protoge (71K) 91 Toyota Corrolla (79k) 92 Toyota Corrolla (79K) and 92 Prizm (98K). The Camry is very clean and although older runs great and is a bit more substantial. The Mazda may be the best buy and in decent shape. All have automatic. Corola is clean as well but at same price Camry seems better buy. Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "
"caatwood","October 2001"," Just for fun test drive a 2002 Subaru Outback VDC Sedan - "
"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Actually, I was about to agree with the A6, but I just looked at the specs here on Edmunds. Both the A6 and A8 are 4000 lbs, and considering the A8 gets a bump in HP over the A6, I don't think performance difference is an issue. So, considering that and the fact that the A6 would possibly be to small for you based on the rest of your list, I say go for the A8. I think you'll find the AWD to be the best addition to a car you could ever have hoped for. "
"black_tulip","October 2001"," I'd pass Intrigue only for one reason: crash test results are terrible... "
"paulo3","October 2001"," I would recommend the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry as my choices for a sedan. The new Nissan Altima looks impressive but I would wait until the reliability of the 2002 is proven.The new BMW 525 is another nice car and is rated highly by many auto publications. "
"kostamojen2","October 2001"," The only way to figure out what car you like is a test drive. And theres no reason to not test drive every car on the market But dont just test drive one car and say ""oh, i like it"" cause if you dont test drive the best cars and all the cars in your price range even (or out, helps as well), then you dont have any reference :P "
"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "
"jdbtensai","October 2001"," i'm thinking of getting an audi s4 in the near future. anybody have one? what did you compare it with? anybody think of getting one and not get one? why? what did you get? "
"stgreen","October 2001"," I looked at S4 and 330xi. i liked s4 interior and exterior better, but ride was harsh as a daily commuter (17"" summer tires and wheels) and sport suspension as well. also, as a lease, i was going to have to purchase 4 snow tires (actually 5 - one for the trunk), because i live in new england...but, i really liked driving the s4. if it was for around town with little commute day in day out, i would have opted for s4..hope it helps.ps- i may ultimately get out of bmw lease early due to car having VERY little space and go for loaded passat GLX - what some call an audi A5... "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "
"dindak","October 2001"," This topic is way too broad. People are in at all different price points and vehicle types. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, considering yours is only the 17th message in the last 2 weeks, I'd have to say that breaking the topic up would be downright silly. I wouldn't worry about the diversity until it starts getting out of hand. Its more than manageable now as far as I can see. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with. You can't fight your urges, I certainly know that.Personally, the sheer power and performance of the S6 would make me overlook the fact that its a wagon. My conscience would keep me awake at night if I chose a slower sedan just because its a sedan. But that's me. If it bothers you then stay clear. You have to be happy in your choice.good luck. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them).

The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside.

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "
"jdbtensai","October 2001"," i'm thinking of getting an audi s4 in the near future. anybody have one? what did you compare it with? anybody think of getting one and not get one? why? what did you get? "
"stgreen","October 2001"," I looked at S4 and 330xi. i liked s4 interior and exterior better, but ride was harsh as a daily commuter (17"" summer tires and wheels) and sport suspension as well. also, as a lease, i was going to have to purchase 4 snow tires (actually 5 - one for the trunk), because i live in new england...but, i really liked driving the s4. if it was for around town with little commute day in day out, i would have opted for s4..hope it helps.ps- i may ultimately get out of bmw lease early due to car having VERY little space and go for loaded passat GLX - what some call an audi A5... "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "
"dindak","October 2001"," This topic is way too broad. People are in at all different price points and vehicle types. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, considering yours is only the 17th message in the last 2 weeks, I'd have to say that breaking the topic up would be downright silly. I wouldn't worry about the diversity until it starts getting out of hand. Its more than manageable now as far as I can see. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with. You can't fight your urges, I certainly know that.Personally, the sheer power and performance of the S6 would make me overlook the fact that its a wagon. My conscience would keep me awake at night if I chose a slower sedan just because its a sedan. But that's me. If it bothers you then stay clear. You have to be happy in your choice.good luck. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

"kostamojen2","October 2001"," The only way to figure out what car you like is a test drive.

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "

"
"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, considering yours is only the 17th message in the last 2 weeks, I'd have to say that breaking the topic up would be downright silly. I wouldn't worry about the diversity until it starts getting out of hand. Its more than manageable now as far as I can see. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with. You can't fight your urges, I certainly know that.Personally, the sheer power and performance of the S6 would make me overlook the fact that its a wagon. My conscience would keep me awake at night if I chose a slower sedan just because its a sedan. But that's me. If it bothers you then stay clear. You have to be happy in your choice.good luck. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape.

"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago.

Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "

"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom.

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news.

Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside.

"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain? I'd like to spend as little as possible (who wouldn't?) but of course don't want to end up paying for it later.Thanks! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"peteri1","October 2001"," LS, A8 and the Q feel larger than the A6. To get an A8 similarly equipped to the Q or A6, the sticker would balloon to $73,000. The LS would come in at $63,000, the Q at $59400 and the A6 at about $56,500. Also, the A8 interior, although classy, looks dated compared to the others. It looks like for 2002, the A6 has dropped its ambitions, atmospheres options.The Audi's best color combination (in my opinion)is limited to the S6 Avant Wagon. After re-reviewing all the specs, I'd rank them A6, Q45, A8 and LS430. However, I consider them all great. Whoever deals will get the nod. "
"jdbtensai","October 2001"," i'm thinking of getting an audi s4 in the near future. anybody have one? what did you compare it with? anybody think of getting one and not get one? why? what did you get? "
"stgreen","October 2001"," I looked at S4 and 330xi. i liked s4 interior and exterior better, but ride was harsh as a daily commuter (17"" summer tires and wheels) and sport suspension as well. also, as a lease, i was going to have to purchase 4 snow tires (actually 5 - one for the trunk), because i live in new england...but, i really liked driving the s4. if it was for around town with little commute day in day out, i would have opted for s4..hope it helps.ps- i may ultimately get out of bmw lease early due to car having VERY little space and go for loaded passat GLX - what some call an audi A5... "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," So why not go for the S6 Avant? I think that is a great car. Are you just not ready for that switch to a wagon?  "
"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon. A four door is a business need, which I don't mind--wouldn't get a coupe anyway.I can't understand why no one's buying the new Q. It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom. They'll have to sell a lot of steel (or aluminum) to pay for it. "

"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, considering yours is only the 17th message in the last 2 weeks, I'd have to say that breaking the topic up would be downright silly. I wouldn't worry about the diversity until it starts getting out of hand. Its more than manageable now as far as I can see. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Well, obviously, you gotta get what you'll be happy with. You can't fight your urges, I certainly know that.Personally, the sheer power and performance of the S6 would make me overlook the fact that its a wagon. My conscience would keep me awake at night if I chose a slower sedan just because its a sedan. But that's me. If it bothers you then stay clear. You have to be happy in your choice.good luck. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain? I'd like to spend as little as possible (who wouldn't?) but of course don't want to end up paying for it later.Thanks! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"peteri1","October 2001"," My wife's got a Trooper and two of three kids are gone and the one left has his own wheels, old, but running. My mid-life crisis mentality won't let me get a wagon.

It's got the most equipment for the dollar, although Motorwerks in Barrington, Illinois claims to be selling their Premium-equipped Qs at sticker. Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing. When I got my GS400, I ended up travelling 40 miles for the best deal and never established a relationship with the dealer. The local Audi dealer is building a huge new showroom.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

Their Lexus mindset isn't putting many Qs on the road. There is always 3-4 Premium Qs on the lot.I hope to have a couple brands competing.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago.

"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think.

"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "

"
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles?

"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times.

A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it.

"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think.

"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times.

I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them).

"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think.

"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist.

"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," I'm thinking of trading up to a new car next spring. Although that's quite some time away, I'm considering my options now in preparation for my decision. I have a Camry LE V6 that I'm reasonably happy with, but I would like better handling and more attractive (and less common) styling. I'd also like a few more ""luxury type"" features than I have now. I haven't had any problems with my Camry so far, but I'm drawn to the Passat, which has everything that I'm looking for. My only concern with the Passat is reliability, which the Camry has without a doubt. I recently test drove the Passat GLX and the Camry SE V6 and while I liked them both, I liked the ride of the Passat better. I also drove the Camry XLE but it felt heavy and sluggish, with even softer handling than my LE. The SE (having a sport suspension) had better handling than my car but a rougher ride than I'm used to. The Passat's handling and ride was between the two. Better handling than my Camry LE and a smoother ride than the 2002 Camry SE. However, the Camry SE comes with a certain assurance of better reliability. Pricewise, the Passat is more expensive, but it seems to have better lease terms. The Passat may also be a slightly safer car, I don't think the 2002 Camry test results are in yet.I have plenty of time, which is good, because this is a hard choice if I decide to trade my current car. My husband thinks I'd be crazy to trade in my reliable Camry for a Passat. However, I really like the Passat better, even than the newly redesigned Camry. Whatever car I'm driving, I would like it to be reliable (of course).How does one choose between two excellent automobiles? I have posted on the Passat forum as well as the Camry forum, but I would like to see what comments this topic generates, given the title.Thanks!SilverCrown "
"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially. This might be a little too practical,but how about keeping the Camry for a while longer and be good about saving/investing what would be new car payments? Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," "
"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist.

I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

I have looked at 96 Mazca Protoge (71K) 91 Toyota Corrolla (79k) 92 Toyota Corrolla (79K) and 92 Prizm (98K). The Camry is very clean and although older runs great and is a bit more substantial. The Mazda may be the best buy and in decent shape. All have automatic. Corola is clean as well but at same price Camry seems better buy. Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra.

"merckx","October 2001"," Silvercrown,trading in your Camry anytime soon will be a bad idea,financially.

Then,in say 18 0r 24 months,buying your dream car,a BMW525i? If necessary,get it stripped. I LOVE my new Passat. And as much interest as you seem to have in cars,I would really suggest you consider a 5-spd. manual. It really adds a lot of fun to a daily drive. You've really got to master it to understand what I'm saying,and it IS easy.I considered a BMW 525i,but the Passat actually has a bigger back seat. The ride has a pleasing softness. And I was a little worried about my first stickshirt car being an expensive one,in case I hated shifting and needed to trade it in.But you've been talking of a fairly loaded Passat.If you got the Beemer with vinyl and no sunroof,It would be more affordable than you might think.

"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.)

"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic.

"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago.

"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.

"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "

"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.)

"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think?

"merckx","October 2001"," Yes,but once you get it,I suggest keeping it for so long that all that matters when you sell it is if it rolls. Or,when it's so old you doubt its reliability,it can make a great hobby,weekend car. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it.

"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"silvercrown","October 2001"," One of the pluses for the Passat is the Tiptronic clutchless manual shift. I've only driven automatics my whole life, although I've been curious to learn how to drive a stick. I haven't had the opportunity to do that as of yet. But the Passat w/Tip would give me a chance to get used to that style of driving without being ""married"" to a car that I may not be comfortable driving. It's a great option.Although I may not trade my car in next spring, I don't think I'll want to wait 2 years. While I'm fairly practical (usually), I guess I'm just not that patient. :-)However, a 5 Series Bimmer would be sweeeeeet ...... "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it.

"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"merckx","October 2001"," It really is nothing like a manual shift. After most play with it for a week or so,they usually just leave it in D...A manual Passat would be fairly easy to sell,as A large number of prospective owners would want the manual shift.The pedal modulation might seem daunting,but it really is easily learned.It is a lot of fun! "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape.

"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"gerapau","October 2001"," I agree with merckx in that it is nothing like shifting gears yourself. With the Tiptronic you can have more fun then with a regular auto tranny but as merckx said, most who buy Tiptronic (or whatever each manufacturer calls it) tend to play with it for a short period of time and then never touch it again. Also of note, most cars with Tiptronic type trannies actually accelerate quicker if you actually leave them in drive instead of trying to change gears yourself. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside.

"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain? I'd like to spend as little as possible (who wouldn't?) but of course don't want to end up paying for it later.Thanks! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof. Antilock brakes costs $500 more. no lumbar support. lower warrenty than other 2 cars (3yr/36k miles)Alero - Antilock brakes and traction control standard. no sunroof, or lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrentyElantra - Can pick sunroof OR antilock brakes, not both. Seats have lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrenty. ""Laugh"" factor. ie: Friends laugh at you for buying a Hyundai.ok, i have a 93 sentra w/180k miles that beginning fall apart. It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration. But i do drive long trips. Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," all these manumatics are a waste of time. Just a gimmick. In the year or so that I've had my CL-S, I think I've used the sportshift 4 times. Somehow, as a driver, you're programmed to either drive an automatic with total non-involvement, or a stick for which you have to invoke hand and foot. A manumatic, being in between, screws up your internal programming. I find when I use it, I have to consciously think about when to upshift, and when to downshift. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag.

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago.

With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Not to defend the manumatic, but not ALL are a waste of time. We're talking about cars that, frankly, are on the low-end when it comes to this kind of technology. I really wish I still had that link, but someone on one of these boards quite some time ago posted a link to a BMW that was being developed with a manumatic that performed better than any previously produced transmission (manual or auto). Microsecond shift times and the ability to rev before engaging first, among other features.The Acuras, the Audis, and pretty much every other current mass produced car that can be had by the regular working man offers a manumatic that IS, as canadiancl put it, a gimmick, but that doesn't mean that a good one doesn't exist. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it.

"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago.

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing.

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," After exhausting all of the info in all of the topics and having absorbed as much info as I can stand, I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell.The A8, feature for feature, IMO, shouldn't command the added $$ over the A6. Why pay more for aluminum? The interiors are almost identical. It's down to the LS430 and the A6 4.2. Two different cars--quattro vs. the Lexus experience. I'll be interested to see if Lexus' residual value will make it price competitive vs. an Audi which will sticker for $6500 less with no cost maintenance to boot. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "

A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"qbrozen","October 2001"," Ah, I was wondering if you had decided yet. Interestingly enough, there is a comparo in this month's Motor Trend for these ""entry luxo sedans"" (as they call them). And, they brought up a car that I can't believe I didn't think of (considering I drive one, its even more absurd) - the Volvo. All of the testers in that article picked the volvo as the best. They only used the S60 2.4T in their comparo, to boot. My suggestion is to check out the S60 T5. I think you will be impressed. (I drive a '98 S70 T5 and it is amazing.) And, as they also pointed out, its one of the cheaper of the bunch as well. "
"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell"" - peteri.So what? This sounds like an ideal situation for you. A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think.

"corsicachevy","October 2001"," ""I've eliminated the Q45 and the A8. The Q, as loaded as it is, just doesn't hold up to a $59K plus price tag. If you slapped a Lexus or BMW badge on it, you probably couldn't find one. With the Infiniti emblem, they just don't sell"" - peteri.So what? This sounds like an ideal situation for you. A manufacturer (Nissan) has put together an attractive, capable car that has not caught on with the buying public. Right now should be a good time to deal. Don't be fearful of a product line just because the ""masses"" don't like it. Be unique and get the new Q (of the four cars you're looking at) - it seems to be quite a pleasant car.If it were me, I would look at the new, top-of-the-line Audi A4. "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends.

VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof. Antilock brakes costs $500 more. no lumbar support. lower warrenty than other 2 cars (3yr/36k miles)Alero - Antilock brakes and traction control standard. no sunroof, or lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrentyElantra - Can pick sunroof OR antilock brakes, not both. Seats have lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrenty. ""Laugh"" factor. ie: Friends laugh at you for buying a Hyundai.ok, i have a 93 sentra w/180k miles that beginning fall apart. It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration. But i do drive long trips. Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive.

If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","October 2001"," The new Infiniti I35 is one fine-looking car, and seem to be a hell of a bargain. "
"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof. Antilock brakes costs $500 more. no lumbar support. lower warrenty than other 2 cars (3yr/36k miles)Alero - Antilock brakes and traction control standard. no sunroof, or lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrentyElantra - Can pick sunroof OR antilock brakes, not both. Seats have lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrenty. ""Laugh"" factor. ie: Friends laugh at you for buying a Hyundai.ok, i have a 93 sentra w/180k miles that beginning fall apart. It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration. But i do drive long trips. Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family.

So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive.

"stebu","October 2001"," I agree with corsicachevy. You could be missing a golden opportunity. The Q45 certainly lives up to the $59K price tag if you consider what you get from the other cars your considering at (or above) that price point. Also, consider that the Q45 comes from a company that is decidedly on the up swing. The soon to be released G35 can only generate more interest in the whole Infiniti lineup.I seriously doubt that you will see a car as good as the new Q depreciate anything like it's predecessor. It's better to choose a car on its merits. You'll have a much better chance of living with the choice down the road. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "

"peteri1","October 2001"," Thanks for the comments. I do think the Q offers the most technology and packs the most features of almost any car out there. However, here in Illinois, dealers are quasi-stonewalling on the premium package Q's. What they're saying is ""we're holding pretty much to sticker, but with low money factors and fair residuals, the leases are competitive.""My point is soft money is a function of the economy and has nothing to do with the sticker. I've got a few months. I'll take a Q for a spin in what's soon to be lousy Chicago winter weather. If it can handle snow and ice, like the dealers claims and like my 1995Q45t couldn't, I would certainly reconsider. By that time, if their sales are still lagging, maybe they'll spare me the economics lesson.As for the Volvo, I drove (extensively) the S80T6 before I opted for the 99GS400. I loved the Volvo seats, but there were nagging squeaks and rattles, loose trim etc.. I think the Volvos have come a long way, no longer quirky, IMO, like the Saabs. One more thing about the Q--it IS distinctive. The Volvo S80 looks like the S60. The A6's, except for some fender flaring and emblems, are all identical. The LS430 looks like so many Mercedes models, with a 3.5RL rear end.My worst fear is that there will be a 2001 740i Sport leftover available which will scramble all my thinking. If Acura had only come out with their V8 model!! "
"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed.

"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty.

I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"vbnm","October 2001"," peteri1, why wouldn't you consider a 740i sport? i think this car is one of the best looking on the market, saying nothing of its superlative performance. if you haven't already heard, with the introduction of the new 7 around the corner, dealers are HEAVILY discounting this year's 7-series. people on other message boards have reported driving these cars off the lot for as low as $56k. that's absurd. and a tremendously good deal, imo. if you're shopping an A8, the high-end A6, or the rear-drive infiniti/lexus i think you owe it to yourself to check out this classic. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.

Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"peteri1","October 2001"," That's my point.. If they're still around, I most definitely would consider one. That would just confuse the issue even more. The 740i would bump the LS430 off the list and probably run to the top of the list. Since I'm leasing, not buying, I wonder how the 740i, as a 2001 model (being 16 months old at that point), would hold it's residual value in light of the 2002 model being an all new 745i version? "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

The Mazda may be the best buy and in decent shape. All have automatic. Corola is clean as well but at same price Camry seems better buy. Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "

"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car.

So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison.

So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"vbnm","October 2001"," sorry, peteri1, misunderstood you. on the one hand, your dilemma about the resale value is a legitimate one, but this is not an ordinary car. more to the point, there are, clearly, many people who DO NOT like the styling of the new 7, and prefer the looks of the current version. this might help the current 7's resale value down the road. the same phenomenon occurred with the current and previous generation porsche 911, which some purists thought became too soft in both aesthetic design and visceral appeal, and with the current and previous generation mercedes s-class, which many thought lost its admirable, anvil-like solidity. anyhow, not to say that the new 7-series won't be a technical marvel, but it's equally certain that, come trade-in time, there will be plenty of people looking for a low mileage 2001.

"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think.

"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai.

"tennisnut2000","October 2001"," I am looking for a used car for my daughter in the $4,000 dollar range. I have looked at 96 Mazca Protoge (71K) 91 Toyota Corrolla (79k) 92 Toyota Corrolla (79K) and 92 Prizm (98K). The Camry is very clean and although older runs great and is a bit more substantial. The Mazda may be the best buy and in decent shape. All have automatic. Corola is clean as well but at same price Camry seems better buy. Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models. I am leaning toward the Altima, but am not very familiar about Nissan or its reliablity record. I know the 2002 is all new and I have driven all of the cars.I know the camry had been the to rated vehicle 4 or 5 years running, but I liked the altima better and felt for the money I could get more. Have had Jetta diesels in the past and my husband is sold on them. But I prefer something bigger and automatic. So if anyone can give me some advice I would appreciate it.thanks... "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "
"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 in rebates from my GM card that's expiring.my 93 nissan sentra w/180k miles has started giving me grief within the past 3 months.

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back.

The Mazda may be the best buy and in decent shape. All have automatic. Corola is clean as well but at same price Camry seems better buy. Any opinions on these cars or other suggestions are appreciated. "
"bigcheez","October 2001"," Hello,I am new to the message board so here goes.I am deciding between the 3 cars for 2002 models.

"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.)

"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

(battery/alternator/starter/and now it looks like i have to replace the flywheel, which was quoted at $700 at the dealer).Anyway, i've looked at the grand am, prizm, sunfire, cavalier. according to edmunds reviews, the prizm is the best of the bunch. But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside.

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back.

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"whichvw","October 2001"," considering the 2002 Passat and the 2002 Altima, but have since decided on the Passat. It is safer (or I assume it is, because of the 2 extra standard air bags, even when the Altima is equipped with the Airbag option.) The interior is much nicer, and I also didn't notice that much difference in the way the two handled. I am interested in seeing what other people have to say though. Good luck. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "

"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago.

Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside.

"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain? I'd like to spend as little as possible (who wouldn't?) but of course don't want to end up paying for it later.Thanks! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"needabeater","October 2001"," some body help find a beater, for winter, for cheap, but it has to run and have heat. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again). You don't want an $800 European car.Have fun, let us know what you find._ "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

You might want to consider a base Nissan Altima as well..... so many choices for a family sedan... good luck "
"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof. Antilock brakes costs $500 more. no lumbar support. lower warrenty than other 2 cars (3yr/36k miles)Alero - Antilock brakes and traction control standard. no sunroof, or lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrentyElantra - Can pick sunroof OR antilock brakes, not both. Seats have lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrenty. ""Laugh"" factor. ie: Friends laugh at you for buying a Hyundai.ok, i have a 93 sentra w/180k miles that beginning fall apart. It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration. But i do drive long trips. Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," tennisnuts - where's the Camry? I'd pick the Mazda because it is a good car and it is newer.Passat .... I'd probably pick this one over the new Altima. The VW has a better interior and has a better warranty now. However, if you are into performance then the Nissan would be the way to go.... with its cheesy interior. "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "

"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain?

"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "

"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "

"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"storyteller","October 2001"," With the radical improvement of the Altima, there are now four excellent family sedans to choose from: Accord, Altima, Camry and Passat. Anyone trying to decide which to buy should spend time scanning the discussion groups for these cars and then do as much test driving as the dealerships will allow. When cars are this good, your decision will come down to little factors of personal preference that you have to make based on your response to the car.But let me add another consideration. New car dealerships vary FAR more in quality than these cars vary. No matter how nice your new Camry or Altima, etc, might be, if the dealership sucks your experience with the car won't be good. Putting it the other way around, many folks would be delighted with any of these cars if they bought it from and had it serviced by a really outstanding dealership. It's an area well worth taking time to research it. "
"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.

"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again). You don't want an $800 European car.Have fun, let us know what you find._ "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

"ruski","October 2001"," I don't know about Audi or VW or Acura's manumatics, but for the last year I have been driving my Chrysler 300M in the AutoStick mode 90% of the time. It is pretty good in stop and go traffic. The auto tranny would constantly shift up and down and seek gears. With the AutoStick, I can just tell it to stay in 2nd all the time. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "
"tikyo711","October 2001"," hello friends, i am new at this townhall. i have been looking around for a good used C280's and C230's. knowing that Mercedes always keep their resale value, i also saw the new Altimas. since the price of a new Altima is about the same as the C230 kompressor w/ 50k miles that i am interested in, which car do you think would still keep their value at the end of 4 years? i will be financing it. will the Benz be a better choice? friends say ""yes"" but i thought i'd consult Edwards townhall for better answers. am i right? "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story. "
"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," The 2002 Accord SE is a great choice. Heck of a car. Lots of EX features without the EX price. But, he said he was looking at used--price is probably too high. "
"afty","October 2001"," Since cars lose most of their value in the first year of ownership, the Mercedes will hold its value much better than the Altima. Resale value on the Altima is unknown since it's a new model, but because prices for the car can range from $18k to $29k, it might not be good. Then again, if the car is a huge hit, everything could change.One thing to consider about the Mercedes is that it will be expensive to maintain and repair. It will probably cost you considerably more to own the Merc than the Altima. Also, 50k miles is a lot to have on a '99 car. Have the Merc checked out by a mechanic to make sure it's in good shape. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "

(battery/alternator/starter/and now it looks like i have to replace the flywheel, which was quoted at $700 at the dealer).Anyway, i've looked at the grand am, prizm, sunfire, cavalier. according to edmunds reviews, the prizm is the best of the bunch. But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "

So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story. "
"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," The 2002 Accord SE is a great choice. Heck of a car. Lots of EX features without the EX price. But, he said he was looking at used--price is probably too high. "
"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," C230 might be a good choice because it has better build quality. However, I am wary of the supercharger (from reliability standpoint). Yeah, 50k is a lot on a four cylinder with supercharger, but I think most of those miles are on the highway so the stress on the engine is not that bad. Since you seem to like MB then that could be the car for you, but just make sure that you have some good warranties. Good luck! "
"dave330i","October 2001"," will be more expensive than the Altima per visit, but you should be visiting less. I believe MB is on same maintaince schedule as BMW which is every ~15k. "
"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 in rebates from my GM card that's expiring.my 93 nissan sentra w/180k miles has started giving me grief within the past 3 months. (battery/alternator/starter/and now it looks like i have to replace the flywheel, which was quoted at $700 at the dealer).Anyway, i've looked at the grand am, prizm, sunfire, cavalier. according to edmunds reviews, the prizm is the best of the bunch. But i would like your thoughts?THXps- Edmunds review on the prism says 0% apr till 1/15/2002???pps- anyway i can combine the $1500 cashback w/the 0% apr? "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "
"caatwood","October 2001"," Just for fun test drive a 2002 Subaru Outback VDC Sedan - "
"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside. "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I don't know about the states right now but the GM Card is definitely available on Saturns in Canada. "
"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain? I'd like to spend as little as possible (who wouldn't?) but of course don't want to end up paying for it later.Thanks! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"needabeater","October 2001"," some body help find a beater, for winter, for cheap, but it has to run and have heat. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again). You don't want an $800 European car.Have fun, let us know what you find._ "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

You might want to consider a base Nissan Altima as well..... so many choices for a family sedan... good luck "
"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof. Antilock brakes costs $500 more. no lumbar support. lower warrenty than other 2 cars (3yr/36k miles)Alero - Antilock brakes and traction control standard. no sunroof, or lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrentyElantra - Can pick sunroof OR antilock brakes, not both. Seats have lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrenty. ""Laugh"" factor. ie: Friends laugh at you for buying a Hyundai.ok, i have a 93 sentra w/180k miles that beginning fall apart. It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration. But i do drive long trips. Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "

"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "

I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal?

"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "

My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "

"storyteller","October 2001"," The best car on your short list is the Prizm, and for a sad reason. It is primarily Japanese. The others are primarily American. That means the Prizm is more likely to be well designed, pleasant to drive, reliable and economical to own. If you study cars very much, the evidence is overwhelming that the Japanese are doing a better job than Americans these days with car design and manufacturing. That's the bad news. The good news is that American cars are definitely getting better, and so your chances of having a good experience with a Cavalier or Grand Am are better now than they would have been a decade or two ago. Good luck! "
"bluewolf","October 2001"," Trying to stay under $30k, but a couple of my choices will probably be just over. This car would be mainly a commuter and some highway miles on weekends. Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

Safety is paramount, but I'd like some speed and handling to go with it if possible.I guess my benchmark for comparison is my Jetta 1.8T. I really like the car overall, enough to consider another VW, but I may want to spend more and get something built better. VWs are nice, but not the pinnacle of quality control to be certain.Okay, anybody who's owned or test driven one of these, or just have strong opinions, I'd like to hear it. Thanks!-VW GTI: 180HP 1.8T or 201HP 24V VR6 (undecided) The new 24V six comes out in spring '02, and I  like my 1.8T, but would like more punch and think a naturally aspirated six might be fun with VWs new 6-speed manual. Also the cheapest on the  list at around $20k 1.8T, $22k VR6.-Volvo S60: Great looking car, reputation for safety. I'd keep the options list simple, with the 2.4L 168HP non-turbo 5-cyl & 5-spd. MSRP is $27125-BMW 325i: Good reputation for build quality and handling. Rear wheel drive and balance supposed to give handling like nobody's business.  Popular car, probably no bargains out there. With sport suspension and HK sound, leatherette  probably still around $30k.-Saab 9-3: I don't know jack about this car. I've always liked the style of Saabs, and they're  supposed to be safe. But they're obviously  different than everything else out there, and  Edmunds said they have mucho torque-steer. MSRP is $27995 for the 2.0L Turbo/5-speed with 205HP.-Audi A4 1.8T: 170HP 5-speed. I'm thinking this is just a nicely trimmed Jetta. Cool options like Xenons and Bose sound available though.  MSRP $25500 Not sure build quality would be up there with BMW/Volvo/Saab.Thanks for your input, I appreciate it! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "
"cyranno99","October 2001"," under 30k... I think that you are better off with a Passat since you are familiar with VW. I doubt that you can get a 325i for under 30k or an S60. "

"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside.

"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain? I'd like to spend as little as possible (who wouldn't?) but of course don't want to end up paying for it later.Thanks! "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again). You don't want an $800 European car.Have fun, let us know what you find._ "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

You might want to consider a base Nissan Altima as well..... so many choices for a family sedan... good luck "
"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof. Antilock brakes costs $500 more. no lumbar support. lower warrenty than other 2 cars (3yr/36k miles)Alero - Antilock brakes and traction control standard. no sunroof, or lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrentyElantra - Can pick sunroof OR antilock brakes, not both. Seats have lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrenty. ""Laugh"" factor. ie: Friends laugh at you for buying a Hyundai.ok, i have a 93 sentra w/180k miles that beginning fall apart. It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration. But i do drive long trips. Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small.

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "

"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"hpulley4","October 2001"," I always wonder when I see such different cars being asked about. Grand Am and Prizm may both be sedans from GM but they are very different cars. What are your wants and needs? Do you need/want styling, driving/handling, passenger/cargo room or what? "
"ronsmith38","October 2001"," anon70: I think the best GM small sedan is not on your list. It is the Olds Alero. It is similar to the Grand Am, but has a 5 Yr./60K warranty. The styling is very sharp in my opinion. I helped my daughter buy one last summer, and she likes it a lot. "

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty.

I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," The 2002 Accord SE is a great choice. Heck of a car. Lots of EX features without the EX price. But, he said he was looking at used--price is probably too high. "
"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8.

"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty.

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"01passatv6","October 2001"," I would also consider saturns if eligible, as well as the olds alero, very nice style on coupe and sedan, although the grand am is aclone with lots of body cladding and wierd interior. The prizm is a safe choice too.Passat/Altima/camry/accord debate, I have a 01 passat and love it, such great comfort, style and handling, plus the warranty is improved, not the bland car the others are, and the interior much better, IMO than the new altima, which looks a little too pontiac inside.

"alculprit","October 2001"," I'd like to buy a used Volvo, something under $3000, 10+ years old is fine. I haven't had a car (haven't needed one in the city) since my 72 Beetle. I wouldn't drive a bug or anything less than a Swedish Brick with all those SUVs bearing down on me. Japanese steel is pretty flimsy.Anyway, what's the best old volvo to buy for reliability and the least expensive to maintain?

"hpulley4","October 2001"," My dad has good luck with 240 and 740 Volvos, and currently has, I think, an '86 240 sedan and an '87 740 wagon; both have been very good. He looks forward to getting a car from the '90s next! This is his first 740. He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all. The fuel-injected 4-cyls with 4-spd + overdrive manual or auto have usually done him well. "

"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof. Antilock brakes costs $500 more. no lumbar support. lower warrenty than other 2 cars (3yr/36k miles)Alero - Antilock brakes and traction control standard. no sunroof, or lumbar support. 5yr/60k warrentyElantra - Can pick sunroof OR antilock brakes, not both.

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration. But i do drive long trips. Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think.

"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again). You don't want an $800 European car.Have fun, let us know what you find._ "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "

He's had lots of 240 series and some have been very good, others bad:Don't get the 4-cyl with carb and 3-speed auto as it is terribly underpowered. Even with manual tranny, the carb engines are to be avoided if possible. Also, don't get the 6-cyl (bad old Renault engine) or the turbo on these cars as it was just too early and is a repair nightmare -- most people with these engines replace them with regular 4-cyls if they keep them at all.

"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "

Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT?

"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," The 2002 Accord SE is a great choice. Heck of a car. Lots of EX features without the EX price. But, he said he was looking at used--price is probably too high. "
"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"needabeater","October 2001"," some body help find a beater, for winter, for cheap, but it has to run and have heat. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again). You don't want an $800 European car.Have fun, let us know what you find._ "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof.

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "

A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data.

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"ghulet","October 2001"," To some, older than five years old is a 'beater'. Do you mean super cheap (like under $2000, $1000, $500!)? Also depends where you live: if you live w/snow & salt, most older cars rust away, and rear wheel drive sucks in the snow.I live in Chicago, we tend to find our beaters on the street, in gas station lots, etc. I've been at my mom's in Indiana, lots of old American cars for sale in people's yards for next to nothing. Check your local free papers, too.Um, some OK really cheap cars IMO (less than $1000):old GMs (77-80s Caprices/LeSabres especially, but they use some gas)80s Honda Accord & Civic 5 speed, watch for rust; I'd avoid Prelude80s Nissan Sentras, super cheap and common (get a 5 spd)Toyotas, of course (mid-80s Corollas, 84-86 Camry)Maybe an old Hyundai Excel, if not ever in a hurry (SSLLLOOOWWW)You don't want big repair$, stay away from any beater Saabs, Volvos, BMWs, Acuras (parts are '$pensive) or VWs (parts again).

"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated.

The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "

My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"storyteller","October 2001"," The car I gave my daughter would certainly qualify: a 1992 Mazda MX6. She loves it. The car is peppy and fun to drive and has been reliable, albeit rusty. The 626 would be similar. Old Nissan Altimas are a good bet. The older Mazda and Nissan coupes and sedans have many of the best qualities of Japanese cars without being as pricey as Toyota or Honda cars of the same age. "

"cyranno99","October 2001"," You're a young guy with a family so I think that you should think about getting a slightly used car. However, I bet that you might have a tough time convincing your wife. Another good value car that you might want to consider is the Hyundai Sonata. I guess that any good car under 20k would be what you are going to purchase. You might want to consider a base Nissan Altima as well..... so many choices for a family sedan... good luck "
"anon70","October 2001"," i have $2500 from my GM card and is expiring. i am trying to keep it under $14k and am considering : 1)Chevy prism LSi w/automatic transmission, and sunroof options. 2) Olds Alero GX3) hyndai Eltra GLS w/sunroof optionBoth GM cars cost ~$16500 - 2500 = $14k. the elantra also costs 14k.Plus/minus: Prizm - Toyota reliability, sunroof.

It doesnt have antilock brakes and it drives fine so ABS is low priority. But i like longer warrenties. And sunroof is good. I plan to drive the car till it dies so resell value isnt a consideration.

Questions:1) How much more does lumbar support add to the ride?2) Whats the difference between cloth upholstery and premium cloth upholstery?3) Which of those 3 cars would you choose?THX "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.).

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it.

"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "

"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "

I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "

They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons.

The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "

"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story. "
"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," The 2002 Accord SE is a great choice. Heck of a car. Lots of EX features without the EX price. But, he said he was looking at used--price is probably too high. "
"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "
"claywaterfill","October 2001"," You answered your own question. You want a sunroof and a long warranty for your road tripping; but, you don't care about ABS and resale means nothing. The answer is the Elantra. You mention getting laughed at by your friends. You are buying the car for you, not them. They wouldn't laugh at you if they were friends. Sure, they may poke a little fun at first, but you could beat them to the punch and take the wind out of their sails. Maybe you could step it up a little to the GT? It would be hard to laugh at leather seats and alloy wheels for about $15k. "
"eddieis","November 2001"," I'm planning on buying a 2002 Jetta GLX or Accord EX V6, but I'm torn. Does anyone have any advice?Also, does anyone know if either one of these cars be fitted with an aftermarket navigation sysyem?Thnaks "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "

"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range.

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I can't say how easy they are to live with because I have not driven one, but Car & Driver chose the WRX over BMW and Audi a couple of months ago--give it a try! "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you do not need a bunch of interior room, get the Jetta GLX. It isn't the same car all your neighbors drive and has a better warranty. Consumer Reports rate them both as ""Recommended"" and they say the Passat is better than the Accord. The knock on Jetta is its size. It is smaller than a Nissan Sentra or a Hyundai Elantra. I know that sounds too hard to believe, but it is. But, for fun and variety, get the VW Jetta. "
"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right.

"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons.

Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"karl","November 2001"," anon70 - I vote for the Prizm as the best of these 3. Why ? Because -1) Reputation for reliability - this car is the mechanical clone of the Toyota Corolla, built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont California, alongside the Corolla. 2) 3/36 warranty is fine, vs. 5/60 for Alero, or combo of 5/60 & 10/100 for Elantra - because most warranty repairs will occur in the first year or so of ownership... by the time 3/36 rolls around, you should have had all the minor bugs surface & be repaired under warranty. In the time between 3/36 and 5/60, nothing major should be expected to fail. (Think about your '93 Sentra - if you've had it since new, what (if anything) broke during 1995, 1996, 1997 ?)If this is a major concern, any car dealer will happily sell you an extended warranty to bring the 3/36 up to 5/60, or 7/75, etc.3) Resale - if you plan to sell / trade in this car in 2-4 years, the Prizm should hold its value better, due to its Toyota roots. Alero = Oldsmobile = extinct after this year. Hyundai = amazingly poor resale value.4) GM Card free money on the Prizm - this should help rule out the Hyundai. Also, check whether GM is still offering 0% financing, and if it applies to this model. This of course depends on your credit situation.-Karl "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I'm considering one of the 3 following 2002 models:1. Accord EXV6: Proven design and reliability. Tops in value. But staid.2. Camry SEV6 (non-leather): Toyota reputation, new model, but so-so styling and power and relatively high cost.3. Maxima GXE: Sweet VQ35, has more standard equipment but you also pay a little more than the other 2, plus possibility of obsolescence in near future as Nissan moves Maxima in whole different direction.What do you guys think? "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one. I've been wondering lately which car would be best for me. I'm obviously have to get a sedan, because a coupe would be just plain stupid to get. I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story. "
"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies! I am not sure the price range yo are looking into but if not new most used Accords are great buys and you really can't go wrong. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," The 2002 Accord SE is a great choice. Heck of a car. Lots of EX features without the EX price. But, he said he was looking at used--price is probably too high. "
"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "
"storyteller","November 2001"," If you enjoy cars and can appreciate performance, it shouldn't be a hard decision. The Maxima is a ton of fun. You can argue that it is a bad buy because of the anticipated sixth generation change, but that argument applies to the Accord as well. Turning that argument around, the Maxima today is one of the best bargains in cars because it is taking a beating from its lil' brother, the Altima. You're never going to get a better buy on a Maxima. Even with its beam axle, the Max is more fun to drive than anything else here. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max.

The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3.

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you're worried about obsolescence (Accord and Maxima), and you're not crazy about the Camry, why not get an Altima? With 240 HP, it's second only to Maxima, but the styling will be fresh for years to come. I bought a new Integra in the early summer of 1993. I had no idea--and nobody at the dealership told me--that the car was changing about 6 weeks later. Even though I still loved the car, I was irked that my brand new car was suddenly old and dated. I think if you buy the Accord, you will have the same feeling next fall. Maxima may not be far behind. I do have one other crazy suggestion. I know it will get blasted and I'm prepared for it, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Before you buy whatever it is you are going to buy, at the very least drive a Hyundai XG350. In a 3 way comparison by Motor Trend magazine last spring, the XG300 beat the Honda Accord EX V6. Motor Trend even acknowledged the XG300 would not make a dent in the Accord's sales, but they said it was the car they would buy with their own money. The 2002 XG350 has a larger, more powerful engine, so I feel it would have to be better than last year's Just a suggestion, though. Of the three listed, go with Maxima. I would probably buy an Altima 3.5, but I would probably at least drive an XG350 first. "
"jimsxn","November 2001"," Some say that the GXE model is too softly sprung to qualify as a real Max. It is better to get SE or no Max at all. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," I did look at the Altima and I really didn't like the quality of its interior, especially if you compare it side-by-side with the Max. I also think the Max's front end is much more aggressive-looking.I agree the SE is sweet, but it exceeded our budget. And this will primarily be my wife's car, and she wouldn't care about the handling advantage of the SE. "
"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "
"cyranno99","November 2001"," The smallest Caddy is RWD... so will the CTS...I'd pick the Acura TL type S for best value - Edmunds' editors choice as well. The Lexus is worth a look since you want a QUIETER car. "
"theworldizmyn","November 2001"," I'm about to have a baby in about 3 1/2 weeks here. I don't have a car at the time being, and I'm going to desperatly need one.

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family. I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile.

"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them.

So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "

"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class.

Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "

I'm leaning towards a V6, because I want enough power to get my family out of a tight situation on the raod, and quickly. So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now. So any advice would be very, very helpful. Very Kindly,TheWorldIzMyn "
"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "
"pat","November 2001"," It's Town Hall policy - thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you had good luck with your Intrepid, why don't you get another one? It is certainly a good looking car. The Impala would not be a bad choice, either. FYI--the Camry is an American made car, as per your requirements. "
"fridgecat","November 2001"," I am planning on buying used (financial reasons). Would like to keep it around 10k. So far I am considering:Newer Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla95-97 Toyota Camry or Honda AccordAlso looked at Nissan Altima and Mazda 626. I will be driving this car for 5-8 years so reliability is a must. I would prefer to buy from a dealership for the warranty. Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "

"corliss1","November 2001"," I lease a 1999 Chrysler 300M and need to choose my next car. While I love the power, looks, and amenities of the 300M, the next car needs to be QUIETER, with better visibility out the front sides and rear of the car, and with a truly luxurious feeling. So far I've driven the 1998 LS400 (must stay in the $35K or less range) and a new Toyota Avalon. Have been told the Acura RL, Infiniti J30(?), and Audi A-6,8 would be good for comparison. Also wonder about the smaller Cadillacs. Absolutely loved the LS 400 and my ONLY concern is that it is RWD. Am in Colorado and must cope at times with snow, slush, and ice. So I went back to looking at FWD autos. Loved the Avalon but missed some of the power of the Lexus. It did seem to have a lot for the money. Again, I love the 300M and want something even better. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You might try Acura TL, Lexus ES300, or Infiniti I35. That new ES300 is a nice looking car (IMO). You mention Cadillac. Catera would be your only option I think. With this the last year of the Catera, you might get a real good deal on one. Acura RL is out of your range at $35k. "

"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference.

If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "

I don't want to break my back with a car seat for the next 5/6 years, so I'm going for the sedan. I'm going to need a good, reliable, and powerful sedan for my family.

So any family men/women out there, preferably a new family woman/man, but a family person period who is willing to help me out would be very much appreciated. So please help me in my decision in buying a car. Oh, I almost forgot, I have to get a used car, maybe, just maybe I can get a new car considering how the economy is working right now.

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive. It has the 3.8 liter V6 that has a good reliability record and the Impala did very good in all crash tests.I keep car's for along time and I'm sure these will be around awhile. If you have questions let me know and good luck! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead. Or, they were thinking they would use the zero-financing to buy a new car, but decided a used car was a better deal right now because of a drop in the used car's price.Please respond to [email?protected] by Friday, November 16 with your story.

My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal?

"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout.

The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV.

I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout.

"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right.

I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right?

"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class.

Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing.

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "
"pat","November 2001"," It's Town Hall policy - thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you had good luck with your Intrepid, why don't you get another one? It is certainly a good looking car. The Impala would not be a bad choice, either. FYI--the Camry is an American made car, as per your requirements. "
"fridgecat","November 2001"," I am planning on buying used (financial reasons). Would like to keep it around 10k. So far I am considering:Newer Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla95-97 Toyota Camry or Honda AccordAlso looked at Nissan Altima and Mazda 626. I will be driving this car for 5-8 years so reliability is a must. I would prefer to buy from a dealership for the warranty. Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "

"heavenbound","November 2001"," Congratulations on being a new family man.My wife and I have a four year old and a eight month old.I drive a 2000 Impala and my wife drives a 2000 Camry.Both are nice cars, but for me I feel safer in the Impala and it's more fun to drive.

"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right?

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS?

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," In fact, with expected big discounts on new Accords, you may even be able to fit a new LX-V6 into your budget. It'll serve you well for the next 10 years.And congrats on the new baby. He (she) will change your life forever! "
"mstssc","November 2001"," Take a look at the S70 5 cyl turbo or predecessor. Large and powerful enough, big enough rear seat for the kid(s) and safe too.Steve "
"milleniaman1","November 2001"," Comes loaded with standard features...leather, sunroof, power seats, side airbags, V6, carseat anchors. With the current discounts you should be able to pick one up for around $21,500-$23,000 depending on options. You could get the S version for about $26,000-$27,500. The S has the supercharged Miller Cycle Engine...210hp...base Millenia only has 170hp. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner.

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance.

"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room.

The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS?

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "

"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," By saying you'll be looking at used, I have to assume you don't want to spend a lot of money. Get a 2002 Sonata GLS. It will have the V6 and all the features you'll be looking for, for less than $20k. You'll get new car financing and the 10 year warranty will provide trouble free driving. The 5 year roadside assistance will provide a lot of peace of mind. What happens if you and the baby are alone at night in the rain and you blow a tire? In an Accord, you get out in the rain and change it. In a Sonata, they come and change it for you. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," I recommend you test drive a 4 cyl Accord or Camry before you decide that you need a V6. The 4 cyl in Accord is especially powerful.The 4 cyl in Camry is very smooth. A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value. As to changing tires in a rainy night, a $60/70 annual AAA policy would have you covered. However with the Hyundai, you will be calling the RA many more times and most likely with much more severe problems than a flat tire. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Here we go again. The question was what to buy. He said he was looking for used because of cost. I suggested a new car alternative and you chose to bash Hyundai. Where is your basis? I guess you owned a Hyundai and it broke down on you twice a week, right? You must see dozens of them broken down on the side of the road every day, right? This is not the place for this discussion, but let's at least talk about things we know about and stay on topic. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I don't remember exactly what was going on, I just know they got a TON of bad press from it and it did sully their name for a bit. Kind of like the Isuzu Trooper and flipping (killed off the Acura version, remember) and the current Grand Cherokee and sudden acceleration. "
"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," You're right that this is not the place to discuss this topic. I will say, though, that I was right in my assumption--thanks for verifying that. Try test driving one before making up your mind. Or--since you like to read--go to the threads of Sonata, Elantra and Elantra GT and read the accounts of many happy owners. That is real world data. I stand by my recommendation--buy a Sonata and forget used junk! "
"pat","November 2001"," They want to talk to consumers who were looking at a used car, but the great financing deals moved them to consider/purchase new instead.

I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "

Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference.

If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe.

A 4 cyl engine will also save you a lot of money in fuel bills in the long run. They also have excellent reliability and resale value.

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs).

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "
"pat","November 2001"," It's Town Hall policy - thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you had good luck with your Intrepid, why don't you get another one? It is certainly a good looking car. The Impala would not be a bad choice, either. FYI--the Camry is an American made car, as per your requirements. "
"fridgecat","November 2001"," I am planning on buying used (financial reasons). Would like to keep it around 10k. So far I am considering:Newer Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla95-97 Toyota Camry or Honda AccordAlso looked at Nissan Altima and Mazda 626. I will be driving this car for 5-8 years so reliability is a must. I would prefer to buy from a dealership for the warranty. Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," I see by your profile that you own an Audi and dream of owning an A8. I guess you have a short memory if you bought an Audi with the problems the 5000s had with sudden acceleration problems a few years back. You bought an Audi because you realize they got past that and are good cars now. Hyundai got past the problems they had in the 80's as well and they are good cars now. Also, Hyundai provides this service at NO charge. "

"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past.

"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS?

"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "

"black_tulip","November 2001"," My opinion about Hyundais is formed based on somewhat poor reviews(especially about reliability...a black dot) that I read in consumer magazine(not an unbiased source, but the best we have) and the opinions expressed here in Edmunds by dealers who go to auctions and report seeing tons of Hyundais being dumped for various problems.Hyundais have poor resale value for a reason:market does not trust them. The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past. No such thing happening with Hyundai. Buyer beware.  Anyway, this is off topic here. Join us in the other topic in smart shoppers if you want to discuss further. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it.

"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class.

Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "

The market is brutally honest and has very short memory. For example, VW/Audi designed a better product and their resale values shot up in spite of the unjustified stigma from the past.

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner.

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.).

"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars.

The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner.

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance.

"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something...

Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers.

"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "

"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "

The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS?

I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "
"bcloutier","November 2001"," theworldizmyn Nov 9, 2001 6:39pmIf you are looking for a new car the Honda Accord 2002 SE (special edition) is a great buy since it gives you the moonroof and security system as well as some other goodies!

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "

I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "

I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine.

"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles.

They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons.

"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000.

"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs).

I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS?

"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "

The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something.

While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash.

"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "

"garyh13","November 2001"," I'm looking to replace my 1990 Toyota Camry (great car!) very soon. I'm looking at a 1997 Honda Accord LX (4 door,power,A/C,65K miles) that is in excellent shape both inside and out. The dealer printed out a Carfax report for me and everything checked out fine. It's had two local owners. My question is, it was listed at $12,900 (which is obviously inflated), I got them down to $11,200 (the dealer put $1200.00 into the car when it was traded in - timing belt, serpentine belt, tires, complete tune up, etc.), is this a good deal? According to KBB and Edmunds, the 1997 Accord is a great car (besides my wife had a 1989 Accord LXi that gave her years of trouble free driving!). Thank you! "
"huntzinger","November 2001"," I recall that there was nothing wrong with those Audis. All those sudden acceleration problems were driver error, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.Yes, but that's only half the story: the driver error was ""caused"" by the human engineering of the floor pedal layout. In a nutshell, the pedals were too far to the left, so the gas pedal was effectively ""center"", instead of being tucked up to the right as we find on most cars. A quick stomp straight down with the right foot looking for the brake...missed.Reportedly, Detroit had the same exact problem back in the 1950's.-hh "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace!

They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues.

I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "
"pat","November 2001"," It's Town Hall policy - thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you had good luck with your Intrepid, why don't you get another one? It is certainly a good looking car. The Impala would not be a bad choice, either. FYI--the Camry is an American made car, as per your requirements. "
"fridgecat","November 2001"," I am planning on buying used (financial reasons). Would like to keep it around 10k. So far I am considering:Newer Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla95-97 Toyota Camry or Honda AccordAlso looked at Nissan Altima and Mazda 626. I will be driving this car for 5-8 years so reliability is a must. I would prefer to buy from a dealership for the warranty. Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "

"annous","December 2001"," I am looking into buying a new (un-used) family car to replace my Buick century. I want to limit my budget for this new car to the price of a V6 Accord.

So, I would be grateful if someone could give help me narrow down my choices and which cars I should focus on.Thanks a lot. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more? Which seems more like you? "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," I thought the Audi pedal layout was just the European style of having similarly sized gas and brake pedals, while the North American style had been the wide fat brake pedal in the centre and small accelerator to the right. I drove late 70's and early 80's manual tranny Volvos almost exclusively for the first years I was driving and found the big fat brake pedal of the Detroit auto makers to be awkward. I never drove an Audi in those days so you could be right about the position being too far left for the throttle.That fat pedal was there for emergency two footed braking, right? Grab onto the steering wheel with both hands and stomp the brake pedal with both feet to use the 'mighty' stopping power of 4-wheel drum brakes. Thankfully, cars have improved A LOT since then... "

"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

"fridgecat","November 2001"," I am planning on buying used (financial reasons). Would like to keep it around 10k. So far I am considering:Newer Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla95-97 Toyota Camry or Honda AccordAlso looked at Nissan Altima and Mazda 626. I will be driving this car for 5-8 years so reliability is a must. I would prefer to buy from a dealership for the warranty. Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "
"suburbank2500","December 2001"," My '87 Old Calais threw a rod while commuting and punched a quarter size hole in the block; Enough said; I've considered these two vehicles, '01 Grand Marquis vs '00 Town Car; At dealers around here there's a $3000 difference; Is the TC worth the difference?

"annous","December 2001"," I am looking into buying a new (un-used) family car to replace my Buick century. I want to limit my budget for this new car to the price of a V6 Accord.

So, I would be grateful if someone could give help me narrow down my choices and which cars I should focus on.Thanks a lot. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more? Which seems more like you? "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I too am buying a family car and have looked exhaustively for the past 6 months. I have spent considerable time during business trips driving various rental cars to get a feel. While I too looked at the Accord due to it's consistent popularity with ""experts"", I was disappointed in it's lack of room (very small trunk)and blandness. I have come to the following choices in the Accord price range:1. Chevy Impala (base) : I like the combination of room, quality ride and gas mileage. After driving it, I had to wonder why you'd I should settle for a smaller car with this power and gas mileage. I must not be alone, since it has been selling like hot cakes and is hard to get. However, if you like a stiffer, smaller car ride, you may not like this car. 2. Buick Century (custom) : This is a great highway cruiser. Definitely the quietest ride available for this price range. Very solid, good engine and again, great mileage. Stereo acoustics are awesome. High owner satisfaction, but styling is definitely NOT sporty. The regal is more sporty, but more dinero as well.3. Olds Alero : A bit smaller, but still more cargo room than the Accord. If you like the sportier handling of the Accord, you will like Alero. 5 Year/60,000 Bumper to bumper warranty is a plus. I also drove Chrysler (PT Cruiser was great, but needs a v-6) and Nissan products, but wasn't impressed with the long term rides. (I have not driven a 2002 Altima.) Although I liked their looks better in some cases, they just didn't impress me. I was a bit surprised that I preferred the GM models, since I haven't owned a GM product for about 10 years.I drive many highway miles, so I place a premium on a smooth, quiet ride. You may want to consider a Malibu. It has a great engine, roomy interior, huge trunk (4 cubic feet larger than Accord). However, I didn't like the Malibu interior and intrusion of road noise.I have not had a chance to drive a Saturn L series, as rental fleets do not seem to offer them. It seems like a nice combination of an accord with a huge cargo area (17 Cubic feet). THe only Ford car I like the looks of are the Mustang and THunderbird...not family cars.I know people that own all of these cars, and they have been very reliable. The only drawback in your case is the resale value, which is not as strong as with the Accord. However, I keep my vehicles for many years, so this is not a concern to me. Good luck, and keep us posted on your thoughts while looking around. "
"iggythecat","November 2001"," Hi all,The lease on my 1999 Accord EX V6 coupe is ending in February and I'm looking at getting a new sedan in the $20-22K price range. I'm considering a Civic EX sedan or a Jetta GLS 1.8 Turbo, w/AT. Aside from being a new sedan in the price range, other things that are important are reliability, quality, and a car that holds its value well - like a Honda. I owned a civic coupe ('98-recently traded for a Jeep Liberty for my husband) and really liked driving the Civic, but I am worried that the sedan will be too small. Are there any other cars I should consider? Any opinions on the two cars I'm currently thinking about? Thanks!Cyndi "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "

"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "

I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "

"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it.

The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS?

"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "

"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "

"annous","December 2001"," I am looking into buying a new (un-used) family car to replace my Buick century. I want to limit my budget for this new car to the price of a V6 Accord.

So, I would be grateful if someone could give help me narrow down my choices and which cars I should focus on.Thanks a lot. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more? Which seems more like you? "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I too am buying a family car and have looked exhaustively for the past 6 months. I have spent considerable time during business trips driving various rental cars to get a feel. While I too looked at the Accord due to it's consistent popularity with ""experts"", I was disappointed in it's lack of room (very small trunk)and blandness. I have come to the following choices in the Accord price range:1. Chevy Impala (base) : I like the combination of room, quality ride and gas mileage. After driving it, I had to wonder why you'd I should settle for a smaller car with this power and gas mileage. I must not be alone, since it has been selling like hot cakes and is hard to get. However, if you like a stiffer, smaller car ride, you may not like this car. 2. Buick Century (custom) : This is a great highway cruiser. Definitely the quietest ride available for this price range. Very solid, good engine and again, great mileage. Stereo acoustics are awesome. High owner satisfaction, but styling is definitely NOT sporty. The regal is more sporty, but more dinero as well.3. Olds Alero : A bit smaller, but still more cargo room than the Accord. If you like the sportier handling of the Accord, you will like Alero. 5 Year/60,000 Bumper to bumper warranty is a plus. I also drove Chrysler (PT Cruiser was great, but needs a v-6) and Nissan products, but wasn't impressed with the long term rides. (I have not driven a 2002 Altima.) Although I liked their looks better in some cases, they just didn't impress me. I was a bit surprised that I preferred the GM models, since I haven't owned a GM product for about 10 years.I drive many highway miles, so I place a premium on a smooth, quiet ride. You may want to consider a Malibu. It has a great engine, roomy interior, huge trunk (4 cubic feet larger than Accord). However, I didn't like the Malibu interior and intrusion of road noise.I have not had a chance to drive a Saturn L series, as rental fleets do not seem to offer them. It seems like a nice combination of an accord with a huge cargo area (17 Cubic feet). THe only Ford car I like the looks of are the Mustang and THunderbird...not family cars.I know people that own all of these cars, and they have been very reliable. The only drawback in your case is the resale value, which is not as strong as with the Accord. However, I keep my vehicles for many years, so this is not a concern to me. Good luck, and keep us posted on your thoughts while looking around. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," But he specifically mentioned high reliablility and high resale. Malibu may have a larger trunk, but that'll be all it has over Accord. I admit it isn't the most excting car to look at, but it didn't sound like he was looking for exciting. What kind of resale will the Alero have when Oldsmobile shuts down for good? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If those are your 2 choices, get the Civic EX and pocket the difference. I would personally get the Jetta, but since you stress the things Hondas are known for, it sounds like you want the Honda. You mention the small size--Jettas are really small. If you compare the numbers, it's smaller than a Nissan Sentra! "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "

I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "
"suburbank2500","December 2001"," My '87 Old Calais threw a rod while commuting and punched a quarter size hole in the block; Enough said; I've considered these two vehicles, '01 Grand Marquis vs '00 Town Car; At dealers around here there's a $3000 difference; Is the TC worth the difference? Also, does one handle better than the other in the snow? Thanks! "
"annous","December 2001"," I am looking into buying a new (un-used) family car to replace my Buick century. I want to limit my budget for this new car to the price of a V6 Accord. The main citeria for me are the engine quality, safety, maintenance cost, and re-sell value. I am not interested in additional options like sunroof and leather seats. So, I would be grateful if someone could give help me narrow down my choices and which cars I should focus on.Thanks a lot. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more? Which seems more like you? "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I too am buying a family car and have looked exhaustively for the past 6 months. I have spent considerable time during business trips driving various rental cars to get a feel. While I too looked at the Accord due to it's consistent popularity with ""experts"", I was disappointed in it's lack of room (very small trunk)and blandness. I have come to the following choices in the Accord price range:1. Chevy Impala (base) : I like the combination of room, quality ride and gas mileage. After driving it, I had to wonder why you'd I should settle for a smaller car with this power and gas mileage. I must not be alone, since it has been selling like hot cakes and is hard to get. However, if you like a stiffer, smaller car ride, you may not like this car. 2. Buick Century (custom) : This is a great highway cruiser. Definitely the quietest ride available for this price range. Very solid, good engine and again, great mileage. Stereo acoustics are awesome. High owner satisfaction, but styling is definitely NOT sporty. The regal is more sporty, but more dinero as well.3. Olds Alero : A bit smaller, but still more cargo room than the Accord. If you like the sportier handling of the Accord, you will like Alero. 5 Year/60,000 Bumper to bumper warranty is a plus. I also drove Chrysler (PT Cruiser was great, but needs a v-6) and Nissan products, but wasn't impressed with the long term rides. (I have not driven a 2002 Altima.) Although I liked their looks better in some cases, they just didn't impress me. I was a bit surprised that I preferred the GM models, since I haven't owned a GM product for about 10 years.I drive many highway miles, so I place a premium on a smooth, quiet ride. You may want to consider a Malibu. It has a great engine, roomy interior, huge trunk (4 cubic feet larger than Accord). However, I didn't like the Malibu interior and intrusion of road noise.I have not had a chance to drive a Saturn L series, as rental fleets do not seem to offer them. It seems like a nice combination of an accord with a huge cargo area (17 Cubic feet). THe only Ford car I like the looks of are the Mustang and THunderbird...not family cars.I know people that own all of these cars, and they have been very reliable. The only drawback in your case is the resale value, which is not as strong as with the Accord. However, I keep my vehicles for many years, so this is not a concern to me. Good luck, and keep us posted on your thoughts while looking around. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," But he specifically mentioned high reliablility and high resale. Malibu may have a larger trunk, but that'll be all it has over Accord. I admit it isn't the most excting car to look at, but it didn't sound like he was looking for exciting. What kind of resale will the Alero have when Oldsmobile shuts down for good? "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I agree about the resale point. I do not think the Alero will lose much resale value since it shares a platform with the Grand Am. As far as the Malibu, which I am not a big fan of, the torquey 3.1 V-6 (standard)will leave an accord in the dust. Not that I like to burn rubber, but the malibu engine does make for surprisingly fun driving. Since I know people who own these cars, I am not concerned about their reliability...especially the Century. GM has made great strides in quality (except with the cavalier). Therefore, it comes down to everyday usefulness vs resale. When I need to carry a stroller, portacrib and other family essentials, I need room. In this area, the cars listed earlier give more real world bang (room and power)for the buck.If resale is the most important criteria, perhaps you should look at a Toyota? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," If you compare the interior measurements, the Civic is comparable, if not superior, to many bigger sedans in terms of passenger room. The TL, Legacy and the Maxima come to mind. It would certainly be roomier than your current Accord coupe. However, after driving the Accord, you may find other aspects of the Civic unacceptable, such as noise levels, power, effectiveness of the HVAC system, quality of interior material, etc. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "

"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs).

I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS?

"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "

Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "
"suburbank2500","December 2001"," My '87 Old Calais threw a rod while commuting and punched a quarter size hole in the block; Enough said; I've considered these two vehicles, '01 Grand Marquis vs '00 Town Car; At dealers around here there's a $3000 difference; Is the TC worth the difference? Also, does one handle better than the other in the snow? Thanks! "
"annous","December 2001"," I am looking into buying a new (un-used) family car to replace my Buick century. I want to limit my budget for this new car to the price of a V6 Accord. The main citeria for me are the engine quality, safety, maintenance cost, and re-sell value. I am not interested in additional options like sunroof and leather seats. So, I would be grateful if someone could give help me narrow down my choices and which cars I should focus on.Thanks a lot. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more? Which seems more like you? "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I too am buying a family car and have looked exhaustively for the past 6 months. I have spent considerable time during business trips driving various rental cars to get a feel. While I too looked at the Accord due to it's consistent popularity with ""experts"", I was disappointed in it's lack of room (very small trunk)and blandness. I have come to the following choices in the Accord price range:1. Chevy Impala (base) : I like the combination of room, quality ride and gas mileage. After driving it, I had to wonder why you'd I should settle for a smaller car with this power and gas mileage. I must not be alone, since it has been selling like hot cakes and is hard to get. However, if you like a stiffer, smaller car ride, you may not like this car. 2. Buick Century (custom) : This is a great highway cruiser. Definitely the quietest ride available for this price range. Very solid, good engine and again, great mileage. Stereo acoustics are awesome. High owner satisfaction, but styling is definitely NOT sporty. The regal is more sporty, but more dinero as well.3. Olds Alero : A bit smaller, but still more cargo room than the Accord. If you like the sportier handling of the Accord, you will like Alero. 5 Year/60,000 Bumper to bumper warranty is a plus. I also drove Chrysler (PT Cruiser was great, but needs a v-6) and Nissan products, but wasn't impressed with the long term rides. (I have not driven a 2002 Altima.) Although I liked their looks better in some cases, they just didn't impress me. I was a bit surprised that I preferred the GM models, since I haven't owned a GM product for about 10 years.I drive many highway miles, so I place a premium on a smooth, quiet ride. You may want to consider a Malibu. It has a great engine, roomy interior, huge trunk (4 cubic feet larger than Accord). However, I didn't like the Malibu interior and intrusion of road noise.I have not had a chance to drive a Saturn L series, as rental fleets do not seem to offer them. It seems like a nice combination of an accord with a huge cargo area (17 Cubic feet). THe only Ford car I like the looks of are the Mustang and THunderbird...not family cars.I know people that own all of these cars, and they have been very reliable. The only drawback in your case is the resale value, which is not as strong as with the Accord. However, I keep my vehicles for many years, so this is not a concern to me. Good luck, and keep us posted on your thoughts while looking around. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," But he specifically mentioned high reliablility and high resale. Malibu may have a larger trunk, but that'll be all it has over Accord. I admit it isn't the most excting car to look at, but it didn't sound like he was looking for exciting. What kind of resale will the Alero have when Oldsmobile shuts down for good? "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I agree about the resale point. I do not think the Alero will lose much resale value since it shares a platform with the Grand Am. As far as the Malibu, which I am not a big fan of, the torquey 3.1 V-6 (standard)will leave an accord in the dust. Not that I like to burn rubber, but the malibu engine does make for surprisingly fun driving. Since I know people who own these cars, I am not concerned about their reliability...especially the Century. GM has made great strides in quality (except with the cavalier). Therefore, it comes down to everyday usefulness vs resale. When I need to carry a stroller, portacrib and other family essentials, I need room. In this area, the cars listed earlier give more real world bang (room and power)for the buck.If resale is the most important criteria, perhaps you should look at a Toyota? "
"splatt","December 2001"," Well, I'll throw in a couple points about the Chrysler 300M for annous It's not all that much more than the Accord V6 if you get an 01 since they're offering 0% as well as up to $7-8k off sticker.For the family - it's roomy. I can seat 3 adults in the back of mine. Very comfortable ride. Lots of amenities, as it is in the lux/near-lux group.For the driver - very sporty. For a car that size to go 0-60 in under 8sec is pretty good. Handles very well - for $500 there's a performance package that has a little stiffer, but sportier ride depending on what you need.Thought I'd just mention it  "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," can someone help me. a used avalon xls 1999 w/30,000 miles vs. a new honda lx 4 cyl. Bothare about $17,000. New vs. higher end used.Any opinions? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "

"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you had good luck with your Intrepid, why don't you get another one? It is certainly a good looking car. The Impala would not be a bad choice, either. FYI--the Camry is an American made car, as per your requirements. "

So far I am considering:Newer Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla95-97 Toyota Camry or Honda AccordAlso looked at Nissan Altima and Mazda 626. I will be driving this car for 5-8 years so reliability is a must. I would prefer to buy from a dealership for the warranty. Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "
"suburbank2500","December 2001"," My '87 Old Calais threw a rod while commuting and punched a quarter size hole in the block; Enough said; I've considered these two vehicles, '01 Grand Marquis vs '00 Town Car; At dealers around here there's a $3000 difference; Is the TC worth the difference? Also, does one handle better than the other in the snow? Thanks! "
"annous","December 2001"," I am looking into buying a new (un-used) family car to replace my Buick century. I want to limit my budget for this new car to the price of a V6 Accord. The main citeria for me are the engine quality, safety, maintenance cost, and re-sell value. I am not interested in additional options like sunroof and leather seats. So, I would be grateful if someone could give help me narrow down my choices and which cars I should focus on.Thanks a lot. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more? Which seems more like you? "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I too am buying a family car and have looked exhaustively for the past 6 months. I have spent considerable time during business trips driving various rental cars to get a feel. While I too looked at the Accord due to it's consistent popularity with ""experts"", I was disappointed in it's lack of room (very small trunk)and blandness. I have come to the following choices in the Accord price range:1. Chevy Impala (base) : I like the combination of room, quality ride and gas mileage. After driving it, I had to wonder why you'd I should settle for a smaller car with this power and gas mileage. I must not be alone, since it has been selling like hot cakes and is hard to get. However, if you like a stiffer, smaller car ride, you may not like this car. 2. Buick Century (custom) : This is a great highway cruiser. Definitely the quietest ride available for this price range. Very solid, good engine and again, great mileage. Stereo acoustics are awesome. High owner satisfaction, but styling is definitely NOT sporty. The regal is more sporty, but more dinero as well.3. Olds Alero : A bit smaller, but still more cargo room than the Accord. If you like the sportier handling of the Accord, you will like Alero. 5 Year/60,000 Bumper to bumper warranty is a plus. I also drove Chrysler (PT Cruiser was great, but needs a v-6) and Nissan products, but wasn't impressed with the long term rides. (I have not driven a 2002 Altima.) Although I liked their looks better in some cases, they just didn't impress me. I was a bit surprised that I preferred the GM models, since I haven't owned a GM product for about 10 years.I drive many highway miles, so I place a premium on a smooth, quiet ride. You may want to consider a Malibu. It has a great engine, roomy interior, huge trunk (4 cubic feet larger than Accord). However, I didn't like the Malibu interior and intrusion of road noise.I have not had a chance to drive a Saturn L series, as rental fleets do not seem to offer them. It seems like a nice combination of an accord with a huge cargo area (17 Cubic feet). THe only Ford car I like the looks of are the Mustang and THunderbird...not family cars.I know people that own all of these cars, and they have been very reliable. The only drawback in your case is the resale value, which is not as strong as with the Accord. However, I keep my vehicles for many years, so this is not a concern to me. Good luck, and keep us posted on your thoughts while looking around. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," But he specifically mentioned high reliablility and high resale. Malibu may have a larger trunk, but that'll be all it has over Accord. I admit it isn't the most excting car to look at, but it didn't sound like he was looking for exciting. What kind of resale will the Alero have when Oldsmobile shuts down for good? "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I agree about the resale point. I do not think the Alero will lose much resale value since it shares a platform with the Grand Am. As far as the Malibu, which I am not a big fan of, the torquey 3.1 V-6 (standard)will leave an accord in the dust. Not that I like to burn rubber, but the malibu engine does make for surprisingly fun driving. Since I know people who own these cars, I am not concerned about their reliability...especially the Century. GM has made great strides in quality (except with the cavalier). Therefore, it comes down to everyday usefulness vs resale. When I need to carry a stroller, portacrib and other family essentials, I need room. In this area, the cars listed earlier give more real world bang (room and power)for the buck.If resale is the most important criteria, perhaps you should look at a Toyota? "
"splatt","December 2001"," Well, I'll throw in a couple points about the Chrysler 300M for annous It's not all that much more than the Accord V6 if you get an 01 since they're offering 0% as well as up to $7-8k off sticker.For the family - it's roomy. I can seat 3 adults in the back of mine. Very comfortable ride. Lots of amenities, as it is in the lux/near-lux group.For the driver - very sporty. For a car that size to go 0-60 in under 8sec is pretty good. Handles very well - for $500 there's a performance package that has a little stiffer, but sportier ride depending on what you need.Thought I'd just mention it  "
"jpelder","December 2001"," 7-8K off of a 300M? How do you do that? I figure the minimum price for one is about $27,000. I agree the 300M is an awesome car, but let me know your buying secret and what they should cost. "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If it were me, I'd get the Accord. It's new so you'll get new car financing, new car warranty, new car smell--and you don't have to worry about how the first guy who owned it treated it. That being said, if you have 3 kids and require more room, Consumer Reports says that model Avalon should be fine. "
"norbnancy","November 2001"," Your are exactly correct on brake/ accelerator pedal placement. Some Detroit cars had problem in the 60's not 50's. "
"sebring95","November 2001"," If it were me, Avalon easily. You'll have to drive them both if you haven't yet. If you're concerned about mpg then the Honda will do better. The Avalon has 5 year, 60K miles powertrain warranty. Awfully different cars to pick from IMHO. The Honda is a bit smaller, wind up 4 banger, and basic options. An Avalon XLS should have alot of luxury options and a smooth/powerful V6. All comes down to which one YOU like better because you really can't go wrong with either one. "
"todd60","November 2001"," I'm looking into buying a new family sedan in the near luxury class. Been looking at (1) Acura TL 3.2 (not type S), (2) 02 Maxima GLE, (3) 02 Camry XLE, and (4) 02 Accord EX, V-6. I'll likely keep the car long-term, but am concerned about depreciation costs. Comparatively equipped the first three are about in the same price range, with the 4th (Honda) coming in about $4k less. Max and Honda offer better financing. I've driven all four, and am having a hard time making a decision. Anyone have any long-term ownership experience with these cars that could offer advice on long-term value?Thanks! "
"barbi2","November 2001"," Trying to choose between Avalon / Volvo S60 / Infinity I35 /Accord ex v6 or ?. I am toting around a 1 & 3 year old and I am not a meticulous interior cleaner. I want a luxury sedan that is roomy enough for 2 child seats and well made leather interior w/o cheaply assembled parts. Which would be the best choice? "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," IF you looking at family sedans, key word being family, then I would go for the Camry XLE. The Acura and Nissan look sharper and will out-perform it, but the Camry will be comfortable, roomier, reliable and will hold up its value well. Plus it is the only one of the 4 that has side airbags and head curtains. This is a big plus if your priority is ""family"". The Accord is good value and still a decent ride, but if your budget allows it, I would look at the Camry ahead of the Accord. "
"canadiancl","November 2001"," Since your subject line says ""luxury sedan"", I would rule out the Accord because it is simply not in the class of the other 3. I would also rule out the Volvo because I think recent Volvo products have not been reliable. I really like the I35 in terms of styling and performance. The Toyota looks very very conservative if not somewhat dorky, but it is roomy and may be more suited to a being a mom-mobile. "
"diamanteguy","November 2001"," Hey, the camry is a good car. Its the most frequent stolen one, so it must be good "
"hpulley4","November 2001"," Read this from the HNTSA regarding kids and side airbags:http://www.nhtsa.com/nhtsa/announce/press/1999/ca101499.html The article is 2 years old but it is the most recent thing on the NHTSA's web site regarding kids and side-impact airbags so it appears that they still don't know how safe they are for the littles ones. I don't know if head curtains alone are in the same boat. If you need to place one of more of your kids in the outer rear seats, then it looks like rear side-airbags may not be a safety improvement for them. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Hey all,I'm looking for a V8-powered American sedan with RWD to pull a trailered '93 Mazda Rx7 R1 sports car, along with accessories for racing (tire racks, tools, etc.). My guess is that the sedan would need a towing capacity of 3500 lbs to be on the safe side.Anyone have any recommendations? My thoughts were the Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala SS/Caprice. I'm looking at used, not new. I'd prefer a sedan, since the pull vehicle would also double as a family hauler, and I HATE pick-up trucks and SFVs (sport futility vehicles)! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The RWD Cadillac's (Fleetwoods) were good for towing with a 5.7 L (350 cu in) V8. Same engine as Chevy and the Buick Roadmaster also had this engine. I am not sure if there were towing options to be had from factory, which on a used car will be difficult to tell anyway. The caddys capacity was like 7000 lbs (or more?). "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Sorry, what year of Fleetwood are we talking here? 7000 lbs capacity is more than enough! "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," They don't make them now, but I was thinking 94-whenever they quit. Anyway a 94-95 model is old enough to be affordable and perhaps not too many miles. I have the 94 catalog (at home) which I can checkout details. This had a detuned vette engine-port fuel injection, gobs of torque.Checkout edmunds used car guide. They show this was still made in 96 and price is around 10000. There was a towing pkg, which would be needed for the 7000 lbs. Package probably added extra cooling.Older than 94 gets you a different set of engines-avoid these.The roadmaster is good in the same time frame (1994-1996) and there were wagons. If you could find one with the towing pkg, then you can tow a lot. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," fjk57702--ok, I'll admit, I'm a car enthusiast...the thought of driving a Buick Roadmaster or Cadillac Fleetwood doesn't really appeal to me, eventhough it's probably better than a truck or SFV. I think my choice for a pull-vehicle that will double as a big comfy sporty cruiser would be the '95/'96 Chevy Impala SS. I like the black ones. Chevy's 5.7-L 260-hp, 330-lb.ft torque V8, should be enough to pull 3500 lbs of race car, trailer, and accessories. Anyone out there know if the Impala SS is capable to pulling 3500 lbs safely?? "

"bigcheez","November 2001"," I am looking at purchasing an American made sedan.Had looked and driven several others, Passat, Camry, Altima and Maxima. I realize the cars I have driven our very reliable, more then American, but I like the idea of 0% financing and have had fairly good luck with my current Intrepid and previuos cars. I also purchased a firebird with the low financing 2.9. Had pretty good luck with it.I have narrowed the field somewhat, looking at Olds. Alero or Intrigue. Sebring. Please if anyone has any advice, or experience with these or other mid-size sedans your input would be appreciated.Thanks. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," The impala ss is a good choice as it comes with the higher performance axle ratio and extra cooling. But these are limited production cars. A Caprice with the 5.7 engine also gets an upgraded pkg which should help for towing. With towing pkg the Chevys should both tow as much as the caddy (7000 lbs). Without a heavy duty cooling pkg, towing a lighter load should still work. "
"pat","November 2001"," It's Town Hall policy - thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," If you had good luck with your Intrepid, why don't you get another one? It is certainly a good looking car. The Impala would not be a bad choice, either. FYI--the Camry is an American made car, as per your requirements. "
"fridgecat","November 2001"," I am planning on buying used (financial reasons). Would like to keep it around 10k. So far I am considering:Newer Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla95-97 Toyota Camry or Honda AccordAlso looked at Nissan Altima and Mazda 626. I will be driving this car for 5-8 years so reliability is a must. I would prefer to buy from a dealership for the warranty. Been burned buying from a private party before, BUT someone else might have had a more positive experience, and if so, what advice can you give me on dealing with private sellers. Also, how negotiable are dealer prices on used vehicles? Which cars would you recommend (or not) from my list above. THANKS in advance for your input. "
"peccles","November 2001"," I think the TL gets redesigned for 2003 MY sothat could hurt the resale of the TL's withthe previous design.Accord and Camry are near the top of the moststolen cars in the US. "
"wheels4me","November 2001"," don't mistake certified used cars to mean neverhit or repainted. I have looked at many a ""perfect"" car in a toyota and ford lot, only tohave a friend in the car repair business to tellme the car has been repainted all over the place.When you look at a car always have it checked bysomeone who knows body work. Just because theysell new cars does not mean they sell better usedcars. The only thing that you get from buyingit on a dealers lot is you can get a lemon lawto make them buy it back if it doesn't run afterbeing repeatedly fixed. The law is very specificand I'm not sure how often they actually have todo it. Sometimes I think the dealers have betterbody shops that can hide the work they do better.Also, I think they can make alot more profit frombuying ""hit"" (as long as it is not frame damage)cars and fixing them, then to buy a car in greatshape to begin with. The cost to them is lowerso the profit is larger. Just my thoughts. "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, I'll look into the Impala SS. People are asking crazy money for them though:( Do I need stiffer springs/shocks for the back of the SS? It seems that the SS already sits low, and if I hook up 3700 lbs of stuff to the back end, that the car might not sit level while towing? "
"claywaterfill","November 2001"," Are you sure the Impala SS is designed for towing? What about Caprice or Crown Victoria? "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," Yeah, I guess either would work...and I can scare all the other motorists who think I'm a cop;) "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," I think that the Impala SS came with most of the towing package as standard equipment. I can look at my Edmunds buying guide from then. The caprice would have the towing package if it has the 5.7 (or 350) engine. I told you the SS was a limited production car and so will cost a bundle. I think that both the Chevys and the Buick Roadmaster are limited to 5000 lbs, only the towing package Fleetwoods are rated 7000 lbs. Towing packages were options that most cars do not come with. Most of what you get with the towing pkg is a heavy duty radiator and perhaps a different axle ratio. The radiator is an easy add on (I think) and would easily make any used car a tow vehicle.I nearly forgot suspension upgrades. If you add superlift shocks, you can probably get most of the suspension upgrade with them. At least they will let you level the car. "
"pat","November 2001"," Please see pat Nov 24, 2001 8:39am Feel free to contact me off-line with any questions. Thanks.PatHostSedans Message Board "
"rx7r1","November 2001"," OK, what are ""superlift"" shocks? Are they like ""booster"" shocks that jack up the rear-end...I hope not, that would make the SS look GOOFY when not towing! As I said, the SS would be a daily driver for commuting, and serve as a pull vehicle that would tow my trailered Rx7 to-and-from various road racing circuits around the country. "
"fjk57702","November 2001"," Superlift shocks may not exist anymore, but are air ajustable. I had them installed on a 71 riviera. The user can add air like a tire and so with a heavy load all you do is add air till the car is level again.I did look at my 95 edmunds new car prices book. The Impala came with a 3.08:1 axle ratio (good for towing) and heavy duty cooling. Also has a ""special suspension"" which was to improve handling, but should also be better for towing. I am not sure about auto-level control (in which case you already have ""superlift"" shocks. Does this help?I also took a look at fords RWD sedan and new ones do not seem to offer a towing pkg. That doesn't really mean much though.Since you are looking at getting an older used car to use for towing, you should find something that you think will work and try it. If you buy a used Chevy (Caprice or Impala) there are heavy duty radiators available that can be added if cooling seems a problem. With the Caprice sedan, if it has the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) V8, it should have the towing pkg. The wagon came standard with that engine and does not have the towing pkg unless ordered. The tow pkg did have the 2.93:1 axle ratio (I think) instead of 2.56:1 (???). "
"jpelder","December 2001"," YEs, the superlift shocks do still exist and are an inexpensive way to boost load capacity. My dad loves his...but you need to be careful not to overload it. My dad boosts his load capacity (pickup truck) by a good 750+ LBS. Personally, I think he is pushing it, but he hasn't had any problems in 8 years of use.Regarding American cars, I think the 2002 Alero GX with 5 speed and sport package is an incredible value (invoice of $16,000. Lots of features and 5 year warranty. If you can afford more, the Intrigue is also a great deal. Get one while you can.I haven't driven the new sebring, but they look nice. "
"sebring95","December 2001"," I'd surely pick the Intrique/Alero over the Sebring. Much more refined vehicles. Coming from owning several Toyotas, usually I dred renting a car because I get stuck with a Taurus/GrandAm/Stratus. On a trip to HI once, I got an Alero loaded up with leather, moonroof, pretty much everything. Thought is was a very nice car and comparable to the ""imports"" in quality. Smaller than a camry though, as I couldn't get all our luggage in the trunk that had fit easily on the way to the airport in the Camry. The intrique is bigger though. I'd consider one over a Camry/Accord. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," I would check with the dealer or manufacturer on towing with an SS. Often the tow rating is lower with the special models due to suspension or wheel issues. You may need to replace the aluminum wheels, they may be too fragile for towing heavy weights. I would bet a regular Caprice would be better to alter for towing, changing an SS may destroy it's collectibility value too much (and they are very collectible even today)Ford dropped the towing package option on the Crown Vic a few years ago, probably stole sales from more profitable trucks. No wonder everyone buys trucks for towing now. As far as a new vehicle, I would definitely look at the Intrepid as well. I own a 2000 R/T, and it is a great car. They are dealing on them big time as well. Also, Passats have never had the reliability reputation of the Accord/Camry. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," I secured a sponsor for my racing endeavors. The sponsor will trailer my Rx7 to all my track events. It's a nice setup too--Big Dodge Ram Diesel Dualie (large cab) with 500 lb.ft torque--more than enough to pull my car and all the track accessories. The trailer is an open design complete with a tire rack, large tool box, and shelves for fuel jugs. We'll be testing my new wheel/tire setup next Saturday at Putnam Park Road Course. Thanks to those who responded.BTW, I don't think the Impala SS is a collectible. Impala owners might think their cars are, but anyone silly enough to pay what Impala owners are asking, needs a sanity check! "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," Hmmm definitely BMW 740i Sport. I've always found the BMW 7 series to have the perfect proportions of length to width to height. The 4.4-L BMW V8 pulls with integrity, although the V-12 would be even better. I don't like the L versions--L stands for long wheelbase (or for ""Limousine"" in Germany). I guess if you have tall relatives to cart around on a regular basis, perhaps the 740iL is useful?... What is the fascination with FWD sedans? I don't get that. Back in the 70s-80s, everyone drove RWD sedans with no problems. How did American car buyers get sold on FWD sedans? FWD is just so darned inferior with regard to ultimate performance. My wife has a small Saturn SL-2 sedan. In the wet, I can't launch the car from a stand still without wheelspin--I'm talking moderate launch from a traffic light, not a drag strip light tree! On the freeway off/on ramps the car understeers vehemently when driven with fervor (real drivers LOVE on/off ramps!). Forget about driving through the twisties in anything other than a sedate pace! "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," I thought you didn't want a truck. Or you didn't want to own it? Do you still need a car?As for the Impala SS: If the owner feel the car is worth something, then they have good reason to hold out for whatever they can get. And there are people collecting a lot of ""junk"" so who knows what is or isn't collectable. I think cars are for driving but what other people is OK too. The time to have bought the Impala was when it was new or at least in production. "
"rx7r1","December 2001"," The sponsor provides the transport (truck and trailor) for my car. I don't own the truck or trailer. The sponsor was also willing to store my car at their garage, but I drive the car daily so...Each car culture thinks their car is worth something. There are folks on the Rx7 list that think 3rd generation Rx7s ('93 to '95) are collectible. While I think my car IS beautiful and performs at a level that far exceeds the car's market value, I really don't think my Rx7 is a collectible (which is why I race my Rx7). IMO, very few Japanese cars are collectible.It really depends on how badly you want to sell your car for cash. If you want to just keep the car and pretend it's worth something, sure--ask the moon for the car. No one will buy it, and you'll feel like your car's worth something... If you really want to sell the car for cash, then market forces will determine the selling price. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Edmunds used prices for 1995 caprice and impala models suggest that the impala has a $3000 to $4000 premium over the caprice. This is based on market value (actual sales). So the owners have some reasonable expectation for getting a premium for their impalas. "
"fjk57702","December 2001"," Ford kept their RWD big cars. GM, in the mid 80s went to FWD on full size cars to downsize them, improve CAFE, and still have big car room. My 86 Electra was a very nice car and weighed about 3200 lbs. But GM realized at the end of the 80s that they had overdone the downsizing, but everything was FWD. The exceptions were the old Chevy caprice and Fleetwood cadillac. So they upgraded the FWDs, but with bigger cars came more weight. Heavy FWDs are not so good (over 3500 lbs). My Aurora does not spin much even on ice (if I take it easy) and have not noticed any problems on wet roads.GM is moving back to RWD with the sigma chassis. With traction control and other stuff, RWD is probably nearly as good as FWD on slippery roads. The cost of maintaining FWD is higher I think than RWD because of the work needed just to get to the parts to fix. "

"annous","December 2001"," I am looking into buying a new (un-used) family car to replace my Buick century. I want to limit my budget for this new car to the price of a V6 Accord.

"claywaterfill","December 2001"," From what I understand, the Town Car, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria are all basically the same car. The TC has a 3"" longer wheelbase, but they all use the same engines and transmissions. Therefore, they are pretty much identical, mechanically anyway. I'm sure the TC has more luxury features--and certainly looks more upscale, IMO. That being said, if you consult Consumer Reports, get the TC. They say a 2000 Town Car should have about average reliability, while a 2001 Grand Marquis should have worse than average reliability. They say the biggest problem on the 2000 TC is body hardware. Between 5-10% of respondents with 2000 TCs had problems there. That's it--everything else was very good. The 2001 Grand Marquis has its beiggest problem with body integrity issues. Armed with this information, which has better miles (not fewer miles, best annually)? Which do you like driving more? Which seems more like you? "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," I think you answered your own question. I think the Accord LX V6 will offer everything you ask for the best. This is the last year of this body style, so you may be able to get a little better deal on one right now. This being the last year of a proven winner should have no bugs (of course there are no guarantees). Consumer Reports, Car & Driver (10Best yet again), Auto Week, everyone says the Accord is the best mid size sedan. If the looks are a little too boring for you, try the Altima. First year, so who knows about reliability and bugs, though? If you truly want low maintenance, high reliability and high resale, you certainly won't go wrong with Accord. "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I too am buying a family car and have looked exhaustively for the past 6 months. I have spent considerable time during business trips driving various rental cars to get a feel. While I too looked at the Accord due to it's consistent popularity with ""experts"", I was disappointed in it's lack of room (very small trunk)and blandness. I have come to the following choices in the Accord price range:1. Chevy Impala (base) : I like the combination of room, quality ride and gas mileage. After driving it, I had to wonder why you'd I should settle for a smaller car with this power and gas mileage. I must not be alone, since it has been selling like hot cakes and is hard to get. However, if you like a stiffer, smaller car ride, you may not like this car. 2. Buick Century (custom) : This is a great highway cruiser. Definitely the quietest ride available for this price range. Very solid, good engine and again, great mileage. Stereo acoustics are awesome. High owner satisfaction, but styling is definitely NOT sporty. The regal is more sporty, but more dinero as well.3. Olds Alero : A bit smaller, but still more cargo room than the Accord. If you like the sportier handling of the Accord, you will like Alero. 5 Year/60,000 Bumper to bumper warranty is a plus. I also drove Chrysler (PT Cruiser was great, but needs a v-6) and Nissan products, but wasn't impressed with the long term rides. (I have not driven a 2002 Altima.) Although I liked their looks better in some cases, they just didn't impress me. I was a bit surprised that I preferred the GM models, since I haven't owned a GM product for about 10 years.I drive many highway miles, so I place a premium on a smooth, quiet ride. You may want to consider a Malibu. It has a great engine, roomy interior, huge trunk (4 cubic feet larger than Accord). However, I didn't like the Malibu interior and intrusion of road noise.I have not had a chance to drive a Saturn L series, as rental fleets do not seem to offer them. It seems like a nice combination of an accord with a huge cargo area (17 Cubic feet). THe only Ford car I like the looks of are the Mustang and THunderbird...not family cars.I know people that own all of these cars, and they have been very reliable. The only drawback in your case is the resale value, which is not as strong as with the Accord. However, I keep my vehicles for many years, so this is not a concern to me. Good luck, and keep us posted on your thoughts while looking around. "
"claywaterfill","December 2001"," But he specifically mentioned high reliablility and high resale. Malibu may have a larger trunk, but that'll be all it has over Accord. I admit it isn't the most excting car to look at, but it didn't sound like he was looking for exciting. What kind of resale will the Alero have when Oldsmobile shuts down for good? "
"jpelder","December 2001"," I agree about the resale point. I do not think the Alero will lose much resale value since it shares a platform with the Grand Am. As far as the Malibu, which I am not a big fan of, the torquey 3.1 V-6 (standard)will leave an accord in the dust. Not that I like to burn rubber, but the malibu engine does make for surprisingly fun driving. Since I know people who own these cars, I am not concerned about their reliability...especially the Century. GM has made great strides in quality (except with the cavalier). Therefore, it comes down to everyday usefulness vs resale. When I need to carry a stroller, portacrib and other family essentials, I need room. In this area, the cars listed earlier give more real world bang (room and power)for the buck.If resale is the most important criteria, perhaps you should look at a Toyota? "
"splatt","December 2001"," Well, I'll throw in a couple points about the Chrysler 300M for annous It's not all that much more than the Accord V6 if you get an 01 since they're offering 0% as well as up to $7-8k off sticker.For the family - it's roomy. I can seat 3 adults in the back of mine. Very comfortable ride. Lots of amenities, as it is in the lux/near-lux group.For the driver - very sporty. For a car that size to go 0-60 in under 8sec is pretty good. Handles very well - for $500 there's a performance package that has a little stiffer, but sportier ride depending on what you need.Thought I'd just mention it  "
"jpelder","December 2001"," 7-8K off of a 300M? How do you do that? I figure the minimum price for one is about $27,000. I agree the 300M is an awesome car, but let me know your buying secret and what they should cost. "
"jsylvester","December 2001"," Dealers are getting cash to subsidize leases, not sure how they are applying it to purchases. I have seen a 02 advertised for $6,500 off list, it was loaded, and not sure if it was a demo or not. I would find one with a low advertised price, and then e-mail all the area Chrysler dealers and see what they counteroffer. I believe this includes the warranty, but not the 0% if you take the cash. I got my 2000 Intrepid R/T for $6,500 off list, thought it did have some miles, as it was driven by the dealers' owner for a couple of months. "
